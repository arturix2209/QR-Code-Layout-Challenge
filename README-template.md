## Overview

This was my first challenge. Here I've designed a layout for that QR code as it was shown in the preview. I've made a bit more obvious shadow though and didn't add any media queries since the design wasn't different between desktop and mobile versions.

## My process

At the beginning I've put all the elements (except for "Challenge by frontend mentor...") in one container, so that I can move all of that information in a center of the viewport, I adjusted the sizes for the container, set the background colors for container and the viewport itself. As next, I have aligned the content in container (set margins, paddings), changed font-family, font-size. Then I've modified border-radius to get rid of sharp edges and set a shadow to the container and voila, here is the result!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I've strengthen my HTML and CSS knowledge that I've got from online courses from Udemy and Code With Mosh and by reading mdn, w3school articles. Also, I learned how to implement another font family in my code.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Merriweather&family=Montserrat&family=Sacramento&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

```css
body {
  font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to work more on positioning elements since I don't have much experience yet. In general I want to practice more how to create a pregiven layouts, to master new things that I wouldn't think of if I would build my own layouts

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) - This helped me to create round corners for my container.
